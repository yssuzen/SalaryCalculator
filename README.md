This program uses a polynomial regression model to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience. It takes in a dataset of records containing information on the salary and years of experience of various employees, and creates a polynomial regression model to predict the salary based on the experience.

Installation
To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, along with the following libraries:

  1. pandas
  2. matplotlib
  3. scikit-learn
  
Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

  1. Download the polynomial.csv dataset and save it in the same directory as the program.
  2. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
  3. The program will import the dataset and create a polynomial regression model of degree 4.
  4. The program will plot a scatter plot of experience against salary for the dataset.
  5. The program will fit the polynomial regression model to the dataset and plot the regression line.
  6. The program will prompt you to enter the years of experience of the employee you want to predict the salary for.
  7. After entering the required feature, the program will predict the salary of the employee using the regression model and output the result.
